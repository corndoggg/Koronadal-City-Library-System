Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

- Favor stock Material UI components, styling primitives, and iconography instead of custom design systems.
- Keep new UI work simple, readable, and focused on usefulness; avoid overly dense layouts or decorative flourishes.
- Avoid introducing new hero sections; prefer concise headers or summaries that keep screens focused on primary tasks.
- Avoid gradient backgrounds and decorative color overlays; use simple solid colors (e.g., `theme.palette.background.paper`) and outlined borders instead.
- Prioritize clear navigation and discoverable actions so users can move through flows without visual clutter.
- Skip dashboard-style summary cards; surface key counts inline with the primary tables or actions instead.
